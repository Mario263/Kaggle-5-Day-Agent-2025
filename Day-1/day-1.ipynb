      "helpful_assistant > The Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and orchestration of AI agents. It aims to make agent development more akin to traditional software development, allowing for the creation of agentic architectures that can handle tasks ranging from simple to complex. ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, meaning it can work with various AI models and be deployed in different environments. It also emphasizes interoperability, allowing agents built with ADK to communicate with agents created using other frameworks.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **Code-First Development**: Developers define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code, offering flexibility and testability.\n",
      "*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: ADK facilitates the composition of multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.\n",
      "*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Agents can be equipped with pre-built tools, custom functions, OpenAPI specifications, and integrations with third-party services.\n",
      "*   **Built-in Evaluation and Debugging**: ADK includes tools like a built-in UI for testing, evaluating, and debugging agents.\n",
      "*   **Streaming Capabilities**: Supports real-time interaction, including bidirectional audio and video streaming.\n",
      "*   **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**: An open standard enabling communication and collaboration between agents across different platforms and frameworks.\n",
