    "**What**: Tools you build yourself for specific needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: Complete control over functionality — you build exactly what your agent needs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function Tools** ✅ (You've used these!)\n",
    "- **What**: Python functions converted to agent tools\n",
    "- **Examples**: `get_fee_for_payment_method`, `get_exchange_rate`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Turn any Python function into an agent tool instantly\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Long Running Function Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Functions for operations that take significant time\n",
    "- **Examples**: Human-in-the-loop approvals, file processing\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Agents can start tasks and continue with other work while waiting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Agent Tools** ✅ (You've used these!)\n",
    "- **What**: Other agents used as tools\n",
    "- **Examples**: `AgentTool(agent=calculation_agent)`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Build specialist agents and reuse them across different systems\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **MCP Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Tools from Model Context Protocol servers\n",
    "- **Examples**: Filesystem access, Google Maps, databases\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Connect to any MCP-compatible service without custom integration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **OpenAPI Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Tools automatically generated from API specifications\n",
    "- **Examples**: REST API endpoints become callable tools\n",
    "- **Advantage**: No manual coding — just provide an API spec and get working tools\n",

    "**Advantage**: No development time — use immediately with zero setup\n",

    "#### **Gemini Tools** ✅ (You've used these!)\n",
    "- **What**: Tools that leverage Gemini's capabilities\n",
    "- **Examples**: `google_search`, `BuiltInCodeExecutor`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Reliable, tested tools that work out of the box\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Google Cloud Tools** [needs Google Cloud access]\n",
    "- **What**: Tools for Google Cloud services and enterprise integration\n",
    "- **Examples**: `BigQueryToolset`, `SpannerToolset`, `APIHubToolset`\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Enterprise-grade database and API access with built-in security\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Third-party Tools**\n",
    "- **What**: Wrappers for existing tool ecosystems\n",
    "- **Examples**: Hugging Face, Firecrawl, GitHub Tools\n",
